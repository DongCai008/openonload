#LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OF USE, INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS, LOST PROFITS, LOST DATA,
#RECOVERY OF DATA, OR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL
#DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT,
#TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF A PARTY HAS
#BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. Solarflare shall have no liability with
#respect to claims relating to or arising from the use of non-Solarflare products and services, even if

#8. GENERAL
#8.1 Assignment. Licensee may not assign this Agreement or any of its rights or obligations under this
#Agreement, by operation of law or otherwise, without the prior written consent of Solarflare. This
#Agreement shall bind each party and its permitted successors and assigns. Any assignment in
#contravention of this Section 8.1 shall be null and void and of no force or effect.
#8.2 Disputes. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of
#California. The UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall not apply. This
#Agreement is the entire agreement of the parties, and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous
#agreements, communications or representations, written or oral, between the parties with respect to the
#subject matter of this Agreement and represents the complete integration of the parties’ agreement.
#Any different or additional terms of any related purchase order, confirmation, quote or similar ordering
#document, even if signed by the parties after the date hereof, shall have no force or effect on this
#Agreement. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the
#remaining provisions shall not be affected or impaired. This Agreement may be modified only by a
#written agreement executed by authorized officers of each party. No delay or omission to exercise any
#right or remedy accruing to a party upon any breach or default of the other party shall impair that right or
#remedy, or be construed to be a waiver of any breach or default.
#8.3 Force Majeure. Except for the obligation to pay monies due and owing, neither party shall be
#liable for any delay or failure in performance due to events outside the defaulting party’s reasonable
#control, including without limitation acts of God, labor disputes, shortages of supplies, fire, war,
#disruption related to terrorism, epidemics, or delays of common carriers. The obligations and rights of
#the excused party shall be extended on a day to day basis for the time period equal to the period of the
#excusable delay.

#three (3) business days after mailing first class, postage prepaid, or when sent by facsimile (confirmed
#by first class mail) or when delivered by overnight express or other delivery service, to the party’s
#principle place of business.

#Solarflare hereunder are subject to export controls under the laws and regulations of the United States
#and other countries. Licensee shall comply with such laws and regulations and agrees not to export, re-
#export or transfer the Licensed Materials without first obtaining all required U.S. Government and other
#relevant government authorizations or licenses.
#8.6 Confidentiality. In the event Solarflare and Licensee have entered into a Non-Disclosure
#Agreement (“NDA”) then such NDA shall be deemed incorporated into this Agreement and apply to
